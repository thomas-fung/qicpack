\description{
This data set gives weight of pigs measured weekly for 12 weeks in a 3x3
factorial experiment. Data also contains the starting weight (i.e. the weight at week
1). The treatments are 3 different levels of Evit = vitamin E (dose: 0, 100, 200 mg 
dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetat /kg feed) in combination with 3 different levels of Cu
=copper (dose: 0, 35, 175 mg/kg feed) in the feed. The cumulated feed intake is
 also recorded. The pigs are littermates.
